# whatsgroupbot
Python program using selinium package to automatically create groups in whatsapp

Automatically creating whatsapp groups and adding people in your contacts to them is the objective of this program. Unlike many other messaging applications, whatsapp doesn't have any official APIs exposed to the public and whatsapp actively blocks bots on their platform. This program accesses the browser version of whatsapp (https://web.whatsapp.com). The initial QR code scanning is the only manual part required. Once logged in, the program proceeds to create a new group, searches for members to add and selects them, Assigns the pre-decided group topic, uploads the group picture from your computer automatically.

This program is a very basic version and when properly tapped, selinium can do wonders in automating whatsapp functions.
